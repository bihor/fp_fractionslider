# fp_fractionslider v.1.2.2

Professional Slider-PlugIn for TYPO3

Can be used with the "jQuery-FractionSlider", the "Professional jQuery Content Slider Plugin - Slider Pro" or the "Slider revolution".
Note: this extension does not include the JavaScript plugins. You must download them separately.

You find the manual (with links to demo pages) at typo3.org:

Last change: now for TYPO3 10 and 11.
Replacement of the Viewhelper re:addPublicResources. It is now deprecated. Use f:asset.css or f:asset.script instead.
